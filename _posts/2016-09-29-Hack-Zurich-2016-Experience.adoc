.Hacking @ ETH-Technopark

.Some life lessons that I learned at the hackathon:
----
1) I should improve my capability to learn things fast.
2) I should practice coding daily, no matter what happens.
3) I must master the right tools and use it regularly (Vim, Zsh, Git).
4) I must improve my programming & be expert in 3 languages (C++, Python, JS)
----


.Now, the secret sauce for winning a hack event:
----
1) An appealing idea which solves a (real world) problem.
2) Good team with right mix of skills (UI, Design, Backend, Team Lead)
3) Catchy User Interface, and good demo which works like a charm.
4) In case of APIs, caching techniques to avoid waiting for response.

I'm fortunate for the HackZurich organizers for providing a nice platform
to meet like minded and passionate hackers.

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and look forward to attending it next year!
